Lunar Lander Game

Controls:
Left Arrow Key: Accelerates the ship to the left
Right Arrow Key: Accelerates the ship to the right
Up Arrow Key: Accelerates the ship upwards
Spacebar: Restart the game

How to play:
Control the acceleration of the ship to land on the bright blue platform while avoiding
the "greyish" station walls/platforms. The ship will naturally want to return to 0
horizontal velocity, but gravity will keep the downwards acceleration going.
The ship must be fully within the blue platform to successfully land. Boosting the ship 
off the screen will cause you to enter orbit and fail the landing mission. Boosting the 
ship upwards costs fuel, once you run out of fuel you can no longer accelerate upwards. 
Press spacebar to restart the game at any time.
