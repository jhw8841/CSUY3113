Simple Pong Game Controls:
Left Paddle:
W to move up
S to move down

Right Paddle:
Up arrow key to move up
Down arrow key to move down

Game Start:
Spacebar to start the game, you'll be able to move the paddles initially,
but pressing Spacebar to start the game will reset paddle positions.
If game ends/pauses from scoring, press Spacebar to reset the pong and paddles
and start again. Ball will always move towards the bottom right corner at start

Additional Notes:
If you want to change up where the ball goes, you can change the number on the ball_movement
variables within case SDLK_SPACE (pressing spacebar)

If the paddle reaches the ball too late, it'll bounce into the left/right wall anyway
(hitting the ball with the ending edge/portion of the paddle, 
example: left paddle hits ball with the top/bottom left corner of left paddle).

Side/Front collision detection may not be the same for different pcs, during my testing,
at least, there were no issues with detecting side/front paddle hits. This implementation
relies on the ball not penetrating too far into the paddle to be considered as
hitting the front versus hitting the side of a paddle. 
Making the ball's speed slower (RECOMMENDED)
or increasing penetration detection amount (default is 0.005, NOT RECOMMENDED, changes detection of front and side of the paddle)
will fix potential incorrect side/front bouncing issues.
