Instructions:
There are 4 enemies. In order to win, you must defeat all 4 enemies by attacking them with the sword
The two enemies on the ground platform and middle platform near the ground are basic walkers
which walk back and forth on their platforms.

The other two enemies stay idle at the beginning of the game. However, once the player
gets too close, they'll do different things. The flying enemy on the right will chase
the player indefinitely until death or restart. The enemy on the top left platform will
slam towards the player in a straight line.

If the player defeats all enemies, a victory text will appear and the game pauses.
If the player touches an enemy directly, a defeat text will appear and the game pauses.
You can restart the game by pressing R.

Issues:
There is a frame drawing issue with the sword and also applies when restarting the game, but mostly the sword.
Whenever the player attacks, the sword will, for a very brief frame time, appear at the previous location
the sword was drawn. This also happens with the enemy and the player on restarting the game.
For a very brief frame time, on resetting, the enemies and player will appear at the previous position they were at before reset/death.
